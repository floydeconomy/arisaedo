## What we are trying to solve?
Aggregation of data related to COVID-19, whereby, anyone can upload data based on the COVID Initiative Index Protocol (CIIP) that governs the specification for a persistent index and library for COVID related information.

Hence, different users are able build different collections of aggregated data related to the COVID pandemic based on the allowance of data in the IPFS.

##  Index Protocol
The index protocol is based entirely of the IPLD's content addressing features, whereby, we can link data based on several parameters that creates large trees of COVID-19 related data.

## IPFS
The system uses IPFS as the data-storage layer, by utilizing features introduced by the IPLD specification sheet. The goal of IPLD in this context is to enable decentralized data-structures that are universally addressable and linkable. Hence, we can start creating large unique aggregation of data's and rank them accordingly based on the community.

Hence, we would first need to outline different structures to represent COVID-19 related data.
1. Cases
  - Country
  - Worldwide Aggregation
  - User Aggregation

# API
To Get/Put stuff to IPFS

# Issues?
1. Data of cases if of data of reported cases, instead, of data of cases. Hence, we aggregate data based on reported cases meaning that it can be false.

# How?
1. stake token to upload data.
2. stake token to publish ata aggregation index.
3. aragon dao used to aggregate data.
