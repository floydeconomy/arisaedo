## What we are trying to solve?
Aggregation of data related to COVID-19, whereby, anyone can upload data based on the COVID Initiative Index Protocol (CIIP) that governs the specification for a persistent index and library for COVID related information.

Hence, different users are able build different collections of aggregated data related to the COVID pandemic based on the allowance of data in the IPFS.

## COVID Initiative Index Protocol (CIIP)
The CIIP is based entirely of the IPLD's content addressing features, whereby, we can link data based on several parameters that creates large trees of COVID-19 related data.
