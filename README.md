## What we are trying to solve?

## IPFS
The system uses IPFS as the data-storage layer, by utilizing features introduced by the IPLD specification sheet. The goal of IPLD in this context is to enable decentralized data-structures that are universally addressable and linkable. Hence, we can start creating large unique aggregation of data's and rank them accordingly based on the community.

# API
To Get/Put stuff to IPFS

# Issues?
1. Data of cases if of data of reported cases, instead, of data of cases. Hence, we aggregate data based on reported cases meaning that it can be false.

# How?
1. stake token to upload data.
2. stake token to publish ata aggregation index.
3. aragon dao used to aggregate data.
